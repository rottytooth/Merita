CORNED BEEF HASH

3	cups corned beef hash or 1-lb. can corned beef hash
	Butter or margarine
	Dill pickles 
	Catsup or chili sauce

Shape corned beef hash into 1-inch thick cakes the same size as Merita Buns. Fry slowÂ­ly in hot drippings, turning to brown on both sides; or brown under broiler. Cut Merita Buns in halves; toast lightly; spread with soft butter. Place grilled corned beef hash cakes on buttered buns. Serve as open-face sandwich with sliced dill pickles and vegetable cole slaw as illustrated in picture above. 

Here is the perfect "light-lunch" sandwich for that special kiddies' party. Easy to fix, too. This recipe serves 6.
